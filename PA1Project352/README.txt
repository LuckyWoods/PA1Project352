We will be making an interactive program for making the name, ages, weight, and noise 
by using an abstract animal class and other animal child classes.

It contains:
    World.cs- the driver of the program.
    Animal.cs- a C# file and implementation of Abstract Animal class
    Cat.cs- a C# file and implementation of concrete  Cat class
    Cassowary.cs- a C# file and implementation of concrete  Cassowary class
    Chark.cs- a C# file and implementation of concrete  Shark class

Bugs/ None currently known. Issues where trying to figure out c# differences with C++, but I am used to it a little now.
